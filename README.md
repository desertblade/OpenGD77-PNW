# OpenGD77-PNW
OpenGD77 Codeplug for[PNW Digital](https://pnwdigital.net/) and [SeattleDMR](https://seattledmr.org/). 

I used coordinates mostly from [RepeaterBook](https://www.repeaterbook.com/). This allows GPS equipped radios to calculate distance to the repeaters.

# How to Create Code Plug

Download zip and extract: https://github.com/desertblade/OpenGD77-PNW/archive/refscoordinates/heads/main.zip

In OpenGC77 CPS got to File->CSV-Import CSV and choose PNW-DMR to import DMR repeaters.

Be sure to update **DMR ID and callsign** (double click) and download callsign database (under Extras).

If you want you can then File->CSV-Append CSV and import Simplex-FRS-GMRS-NOAA folder for those channels.

When I generate other csv lists for analog and digital repeaters for my use, I will add them to this repository.


## Notes
I am using this on a TYT MD-UV390 running the latest OpenGD77.

The "old" folder is my original export, might be useful for someone.
